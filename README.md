<!-- About me -->
Recently graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering, I have successfully accelerated web app development speed by 50% and co-developed over three applications during my 2 years as a software engineering associate. My work has sharpened my skills in critical thinking, system design, problem-solving, and analysis. At GITS, I developed a system that improved documentation efficiency by 60% through integrating sprint documents and client reports. Currently, at RevoU, I am enhancing my expertise in React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. My commitment to continuous learning and ability to stay current with industry trends make me eager to contribute as a front-end engineer.
